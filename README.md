# open-clusters-modelling

This is a research project to analyse images from Oxford's Philip Wetton telescope and create a model of how old different open clusters are, how far away from Earth they are, and measure their extinction.

This project was initially conducted in a Jupyter environment and I am trying to adapt it to work here in Github.
